# Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations Demonstration

---

## Objective: Use SQL queries to analyze monthly revenue and order volume from the e-commerce sales dataset.

### Tools Used: MySQL

## Dataset: [E-Commerce Sales Data Raw & Cleaned - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martweber/e-commerce-sales-data-raw-cleaned)  
- File Name: `cleaned_sales_data.csv`  
- Relevant Columns Used:
  - `TransactionNo` â†’ order ID
  - `Date` â†’ order date
  - `Price` â†’ product price
  - `Quantity` â†’ quantity sold
  - `ReturnFlag` â†’ whether the order was returned

---

## ðŸ›  Deliverables
The following steps were performed for demonstration purposes on the database:

1. **Database & Table Setup**
   - Created database `sales_trend`.
   - Created staging table `orders_raw` to load CSV data.
   - Loaded CSV into `orders_raw`.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Created cleaned table `orders` with proper data types:
     - `order_id` â†’ BIGINT
     - `order_date` â†’ DATE
     - `Price` â†’ DECIMAL
     - `Quantity` â†’ INT
     - `ReturnFlag` â†’ BOOLEAN
   - Inserted only valid rows from `orders_raw`:
     - Valid numeric `TransactionNo`
     - Valid `Date`
   - Converted `ReturnFlag` to boolean (`TRUE/FALSE`).

3. **Monthly Aggregation**
   - Aggregated revenue and order volume per month using:
     - `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)` and `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)`  
     - `SUM(Price * Quantity)` â†’ monthly revenue  
     - `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` â†’ number of orders  
   - Filtered out returned orders (`ReturnFlag = FALSE`) and limited results to specific time periods using:

     **Option M1**
     ```sql
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) BETWEEN X AND Y
     OR EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) BETWEEN X AND Y
     -- or
     YEAR(order_date) BETWEEN 2020 AND 2021
     ```
     
     **Option M2**
     ```sql
     MONTH(order_date) BETWEEN X AND Y
     OR YEAR(order_date) BETWEEN X AND Y
     ```
   - Sorted results by year and month.

## ðŸš€ How to Reproduce
1. Copy `cleaned_sales_data.csv` from `data/` to `C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/` (ensure itâ€™s in MySQLâ€™s secure folder on Windows).
1. Import `combined.sql` or both `create_db.sql` and `query.sql` into MySQL. 
2. Run queries from the respective SQL files in order.  
3. Check results and compare them with the provided screenshots and CSV file.
